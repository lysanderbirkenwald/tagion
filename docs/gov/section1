## Introduction

The governance framework proposed for the Tagion Network aims to establish a robust, decentralized system where decision-making and the evolution of the network are driven by the collective will of its participants. The vision is to empower the community—free from the sway of any single group or entity—to take an active role in shaping the network's future.

At the heart of this governance model is the idea of enabling the entire community to come together to submit, evaluate, and vote on proposals. While this framework is still under consideration, it is intended to ensure that decisions reflect the collective needs, goals, and desires of the Tagion community, fostering a system that serves its participants.

A key component of the proposed governance system is **transparency and accountability**. Every proposal, vote, and discussion should be recorded on the Hashgraph through on-chain governance mechanisms. By making all actions publicly accessible and verifiable, the system should aim to prevent hidden agendas and behind-the-scenes influence—a level of transparency that will help build trust within the governance process, giving participants confidence that decisions are being made equitably and openly.

Ultimately, the proposed governance model seeks to foster active participation, ensuring the network thrives and evolves in alignment with the collective vision of its community.

# Transaction verification
This proposal describes and discusses how transactions can be traced and proved to have taken place in the tagion system.


## Motivation
Suppose we have three persons. Alice, Bob & Carol. Carol sets an item for sale which both Alice and Bob wants to buy. First person to buy it gets it.
Alice sends the transaction to Carol, but Bob only says that he has already sent the money. Since only outputs are stored there is no way for Carol to veriy if it was Bob or Alice who sent it. 
Also as a twist Carol may choose to send the money directly after receiving them making it look like the money was never sent at all. 


Based on the above it can be seen that there can be ways where providing the history is important. Especially one link back. The following describes a solution as to how we by saving hashes of contracts in the recorderchain, along with the previous recorderblock in the DART, are able to provide history as to how transactions took place in the system.
